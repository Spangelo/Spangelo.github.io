# Welcome to my world

I'm Nicole Spangelo ...

I got interested in coding in 2016. Since then, I've been slowly learning frontend coding, learning Russian, Turkish, Korean, Japanese, Norwegian, and Arabic. I'm on a path to learn Python. I love games and beta test in my spare time when I'm not learning Unity or teaching myself digitial art.
