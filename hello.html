                            <h3 class="margin">Math Prodigy and the Space System</h3>
  <p>Built in  1917 the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was a research center headquartered in Langley Virginia. The agency renamed itself the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) in 1958 as space missions gained speed. Before the use of electronic computers, NACA used “human computers” also know as “West computers”, “black computers”, or “computers who wore skirts”. Few jobs existed for African-Americans until 1941 when A. Philip Randolph proposed a march on Washington to draw attention to racial discrimination.  President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 to prevent the threat of over 100,000 swarming the Capitol.  The order banned all federal agencies, unions, and companies in war related work from racial discriminatory employment. It was in 1953, a year after Katherine and her relocated, that she was contracted as a mathematician for the Langley Research Center at NACA.</p>

  <p>Katherine Coleman was born on August 29, 1918 to Joylette and Joshua Coleman  in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Her mother was a teacher and her father was farmer and worked extra jobs as a janitor. At a young age, Katherine was insatiably curious and showed many signs of being a math prodigy. She counted everything she did, everywhere she went and asked many questions.  She believes she got her love of numbers from her father. Her learning aptitude was incredibly high that she was skipped from second grade to fifth grade.</p>
  <p>Her father quit school at the sixth grade, but felt education was extremely important for Katherine and her siblings.  Since the local schools did not offer classes beyond the eighth grade for African-Americans, Katherine and her siblings were enrolled at a school 125 miles away. In high school, took math classes from William Waldron Schieffelin Claytor. He was the third African-American to receive a Ph. D in mathematics. In 1933, at just 15 years old, Katherine started college at West Virginia State University. She received a full academic scholarship that also covered room and board. Katherine made such great strides with the course that Claytor had to create advanced math classes just for her.  He told Katherine she would make a good research mathematician. She took his words to heart and took every available math course including analytic geometry. </p>
  <p>In 1937, she graduated summa cum laude with her Bachelor of Science in mathematics and French. Shortly afterwards, she followed in her mother's footsteps and became a teacher. She took her first job in Marion, VA. She said this is where she had her first experience with racism, as racism wasn't as blatant in West Virginia. Kathrine married James Goble in 1939 and had three daughters, Constance, Joylette, and Kathy. She resigned  from her teaching positions, but was invited back in 1940 for the graduate program. She thought the college might have been trying to avoid a segregation lawsuit. She was one of the first African-Americans to enroll, but had to quit when her husband became ill. She returned to teaching to support the family. </p>

    <h3>A New Beginning</h3>
      <p>It was in the summer of 1952 when Katherine learned from her sister and brother-in-law about the opportunities opening for African-American women in the mathematics department at the nearby research facility. After a long discussion between Katherine and her husband, they family relocated in preparation for Katherine's new career. In June of 1953, nearly one to the date from the day she heard of the opportunities at the research facility, Katherine was now working in a pool of women performing math calculations for NACA. Katherine was placed in the West Area, the only place that “colored-girls” were allowed to work. Her main objective was to read the data from the black boxes of plane and carry out other mathematical tasks.  Her boss was Dorothy Vaughan, another mathematician who joined the West Area 10 prior to Katherine and had painstakingly risen to the head of the department. Both Katherine and Dorothy grew up in White Sulphur Springs West Virginia. Dorothy was also a former neighbor of Katherine's.</p>
  <p>Two weeks after Katherine started work in the West Computers, two men came in and had a quiet conversation with Dorothy. Shortly after, Dorothy told Katherine and another woman, Erma Tynes that Flight Research was requesting two computers and she would be sending them to 1244.  This was a gigantic step for Katherine, however temporary it might be. The Flight Research center was housed in a 295-by-300 foot hangar.</p>
  <p>Katherine worked for the division chief, Henry Pearson on solving analytic geometry calculations. Soon, six months passed and Katherine was still with Flight Research. Dorothy Vaughan and Henry Pearson had a sit down meeting in the beginning of 1954. “Either giver hear a raise or send her back to me,” Vaughan told Pearson in his upstairs office. Pearson offered Katherine a full time position with Flight Research with a raise.</p>

      <blockquote>
  <p>In 1957, the Soviet Union launder the first artificial satellite into space. This prompted the United States to push the own space program higher which also included another raise for Katherine. Her division shifted from aeronautics to space. Her work became more intricate as she was given more work due to the changes in her division. She was now assigned charts and equations for space technology lecture series. Katherine listened to every strain of conversations.  The real conversations took place in the boardrooms and in meetings. Katherine sat down with engineers and asked questions. Why did the trajectory equation need to account for the oblateness of Earth? Why was it necessary to calculate an error ellipsoid to accurately predict the satellite's return to the planet's surface?</p>
    <p>Finally, In 1958 Katherine was permitted into a meeting after months of asking why she couldn't attend an editorial meeting of the Guidance and Control Branch of Langley's Flight Research Division. Soon, it would be re-named the Aerospace Mechanics Division under NASA.</p>

<p>In November of 1959, Katherine wrote her first research report describing project Mercury's orbital flight, “Determination of Azimuth Angle at Burnout for Placing a Satellite over a Selected Earth Position”. The 34 page books covered 22 principal equations, nine error equations, two launch case studies, three reference texts, two tables with sample calculations, and three pages of charts. The report took a months of data, testing, and researching.  Glenn went through a final simulation of his full flight plan and a review of his orbital trajectory that had been generated by the IBM 7090 computer. Three days prior to his launch, astronaut John Glenn made a call to Ted Skipinski or John Mayer and told him to “Get the girl to check the numbers. If she says they're good, I'm good.” referring to Katherine. </p>

<p>Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson made tremendous strides and made an even bigger mark on history.  She was recently awarded the highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2015. She is being portrayed by Taraji P. Henson in the upcoming film “Hidden Figures” based on the book by the same name written by Margot Lee Shetterly. Still, Katherine has remained humbled. She says “I don't ever wait for something.” She's an accomplished woman that went after her dreams despite segregation and limited opportunities. </p>
