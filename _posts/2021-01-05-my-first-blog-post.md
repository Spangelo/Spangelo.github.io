Hi there! 
Welcome to my first blog post and Happy New Year. I'm super excited to share with you what I'm learning. 
I've been working on my Github blog for the last week. It took longer than I expected while I was under the weather. I'm back and feeling much better!
This week, aside from updating my blog, I'll be finishing up some learning on Github. 
Did you know that Github has a student pack? I'm really excited to dive into and check out all the awesome tools available. 
Until the next post!
